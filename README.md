# parallel-programming-lecture
Workshops and labs for Parallel programming lecture at ITESM


This is a template for a Parallel Programming lectures ITESM GDL
in order to increase the level of knowledge on the undergraduate students of computer science careers.
This is plan to be deliverable in a period of time of 10 weeks
It is adjustable  in time and order; however the expectations and basic topics should keep the essence of the plan.
